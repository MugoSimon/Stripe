# Stripe Payment Integration Sample

This is a sample Android application that demonstrates the integration of Stripe's payment processing functionality. The app allows users to make payments using the Stripe Payment Sheet.

## Features

- Create a customer on Stripe
- Fetch the ephemeral key for the customer
- Fetch the client secret for a payment intent
- Present the Stripe Payment Sheet to the user
- Handle successful and failed payment transactions

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Android SDK 21 or higher
- Stripe account and API keys (publishable and secret)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stripe-payment-integration.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Locate the `StaticData.java` file and update the `PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` constants with your Stripe API keys.

4. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files and folders:

- `MainActivity.java`: The main activity that handles the payment flow.
- `StaticData.java`: A class that holds the Stripe API keys.
- `activity_main.xml`: The layout file for the main activity.
- `build.gradle`: The project-level build configuration file.
- `app/build.gradle`: The app-level build configuration file.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- `com.stripe:stripe-android:21.6.0`
- `io.reactivex.rxjava3:rxjava:3.1.5`
- `com.android.volley:volley:1.2.1`

## Usage

1. When the app is launched, it will automatically create a customer on Stripe and fetch the necessary payment data.
2. Once the payment data is ready, the app will present the Stripe Payment Sheet to the user.
3. The user can then enter their payment information and complete the transaction.
4. The app will handle the payment result and display a success or failure message accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the app, please make sure that:

1. Your Stripe API keys are correctly configured in the `StaticData.java` file.
2. You have the necessary permissions granted to the app (e.g., internet access).
3. You are using a compatible Android SDK version.
4. You have reviewed the Stripe SDK documentation for any known issues or limitations.

If the issue persists, feel free to reach out to the Stripe support team or the community for assistance.
